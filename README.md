# SteamID64-To-GUID
 This Python program is designed for server administrators who need to convert Steam ID 64 (a unique identifier for Steam accounts) into GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) used in games like ARMA and DayZ. The GUIDs are derived from the MD5 hash of the Steam ID 64, allowing server admins to manage player identities more efficiently.
